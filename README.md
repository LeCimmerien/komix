## 1\. Introduction

**Komix** is a web platform designed for comic artists and readers. It allows creators to publish their works as projects, and for readers to discover, follow, and interact with their favorite artists and series. This project was developed as part of obtaining the RNCP 6 "TP - Concepteur dÃ©veloppeur d'applications" certification.

## 2\. Features

### Artist Side:

  * **Project Management:** Create, modify, and delete your comic series.
  * **Content Publishing:** Add and organize chapters within your projects.
  * **Categorization:** Assign relevant tags to your projects to facilitate discovery.

### Reader Side:

  * **Personalized Feed:** View the latest pages from followed projects, new projects from followed artists, and updates for followed tags.
  * **Discovery:** Search for projects, artists, and tags using an intuitive search bar.
  * **Subscriptions:** Ability to subscribe to projects, artists, or tags to follow content of interest.
  * **Immersive Reading:** A smooth and optimized reading experience for comic pages.

### Cross-Cutting Features:

  * **Authentication and Profiles:** User registration, login, and profile management system.
  * **Image Optimization:** Automatic processing of uploaded pages for fast and efficient delivery.

## 3\. Tech Stack

Komix is built on a modern architecture prioritizing performance and lightweight frontend interactivity:

  * **Backend:**

      * **Language:** **Python**
      * **Web Framework:** **Django** (with Gunicorn/uWSGI)
      * **Database:** **PostgreSQL** (with Django's ORM)
      * **Queue / Cache:** **Redis**
      * **Asynchronous Tasks:** **Celery** (for Python, uses Redis)
      * **Image Processing:** **PIL** (dedicated micro-service for image optimization)
      * **Web Server / Proxy:** **Nginx**

  * **Frontend:**

      * **Templating Engine:** **Django Template Language (DTL)**
      * **Lightweight Interactivity:** **HTMX** (for AJAX requests and partial DOM updates)
      * **Client-Side UI Logic:** **Alpine.js** (for simple, local JavaScript interactions)
      * **CSS Preprocessor:** **Sass** (for modularity and customization)
      * **CSS Framework:** **Bulma** (Sass based, Flexbox-based)

  * **Media Pipeline & Deployment:**

      * **Containerization:** Docker and Docker Compose

## 4\. Architecture

The project follows a classic N-tier architecture:

  * **Presentation Layer (Frontend):** HTML generated by Django, enhanced by HTMX and Alpine.js, styled with Bulma/Sass.
  * **Application Layer (Backend):** Django application managing business logic, API, and database interaction.
  * **Data Layer:** PostgreSQL database for structured data.
  * **Services Layer (Micro-service):** Service dedicated to image processing, communicated via Redis/Celery.
  * **Infrastructure Layer:** Nginx as a reverse proxy, Redis as a message broker/cache, and cloud storage/CDN for media.

## 5\. Prerequisites

To run Komix locally, make sure you have the following installed:

  * **Git**
  * **Docker**
  * **Docker Compose**

## 6\. Installation and Setup

Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/komix.git
    cd komix
    ```

2.  **Environment Variable Configuration:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root based on an `.env.example` file. Include essential variables for the database, Django secret keys, and cloud storage access (e.g., `DJANGO_SECRET_KEY`, `DB_NAME`, `DB_USER`, `DB_PASSWORD`, etc.).

3.  **Start Services with Docker Compose:**

    ```bash
    docker-compose up --build
    ```

    This command will:

      * Build Docker images for the Django backend, and other services.
      * Start the PostgreSQL, Redis, and Django service containers.
      * Apply Django database migrations.
      * Collect Django static files.

4.  **Access the Application:**
    The application should be accessible in your browser at:
    `http://localhost:8000` (or the port configured for Nginx/Django)

5.  **Create a Django Superuser (optional):**
    To access the Django admin panel:

    ```bash
    docker-compose exec backend python manage.py createsuperuser
    ```

    Follow the prompts to create your user. The admin panel will be accessible via `http://localhost:8000/admin`.

## 7\. Testing

The project includes tests to ensure quality and reliability:

  * **Unit Tests:** For backend components (Django) and some frontend functions.
  * **Integration Tests:** Verify interaction between services (e.g., Django and PostgreSQL, Django and Go service).
  * **End-to-End (E2E) Tests:** User scenarios are tested end-to-end to validate key functionalities.

To run the tests:

```bash
docker-compose exec backend python manage.py test
```
